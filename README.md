# step_motor_control_and_arduino_nano
Steper motor control with arduino nano for Skoltech
This project implements simple PCB for soldering arduino nano to stepper motor using standard stepper motor driver module such as DRV8825.

You can find a schematic [here](out/sch/pump_driver.pdf). Design optimized for minimal soldering (for lazy students). Also you can find ready gerbers in release.
